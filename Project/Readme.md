575k Rows


## Introduction-
As many as 90% of the Fires in the States are caused by people. Fire Incidents are more often that they seem. Many fires are originated by cooking. The datset contains the incidents to which the SF Fire Department responded. These along with incidents also have some unnecesary calls or the alarm went of due to some normal cause.Accidents caused by fire can result in serious injury and damage to personal property. So we are going to evaluate the chances of fire fatalties.

## Problem Statement-
To predict if there will be any fatalties in the fire incidents or not.

## Exploratory Data Analysis And Data Cleaning-
- Dealing with NULL Values-
    
    - Almost 5 lakh null values.
    
    - Few unnecessary values.

- Filled the missing values with Unknown for Categorical Variables.

- Filled the missing values with mean or median for numerical values.

- Carried out Data Vizualization.

- Dropeed few columns which were not important.

- As the dataset was huge and the duplicate rows were just around 7-10, I dropped them.
